# Project Ideas

## 1. File Processing System
**Description:**  
Build a REST API to upload files for processing (e.g., parsing CSV files, resizing images, or extracting data from PDFs). The processing happens asynchronously, and the client gets updates on the task's progress.

**Key Features:**
- Upload files and get a task ID.
- Process files asynchronously (e.g., store them in S3 after compression).
- Retrieve the status of file processing using a task ID.
- Notify clients when processing is complete (optional: via email or webhook).

**Tech Stack:**  
Spring Boot, Java, AWS S3, RabbitMQ/Kafka (optional for queuing).

---  

## 2. Email Campaign Manager
**Description:**  
Create a system for scheduling bulk email campaigns. Users can create campaigns, upload recipient lists, and the system sends emails asynchronously.

**Key Features:**
- Schedule emails and monitor their sending status.
- Handle failures (retry mechanism).
- Provide a dashboard to check the delivery status of emails.

**Tech Stack:**  
Spring Boot, JavaMail API, Redis (for caching task status), RabbitMQ.

---  

## 3. Social Media Scraper
**Description:**  
Build a service to scrape data (e.g., user profiles, trending posts) from various social media platforms. Clients can request data scraping, which is processed asynchronously.

**Key Features:**
- Clients request data from specific platforms.
- Scraping happens in the background (e.g., via Selenium or APIs).
- Notify clients when data is ready.

**Tech Stack:**  
Spring Boot, Selenium, Kafka (for task queuing).

---  

## 4. Real-Time Notification System
**Description:**  
Create a notification system where events trigger notifications sent to users asynchronously (e.g., email, SMS, or push notifications).

**Key Features:**
- APIs to send notifications based on user preferences.
- Process notifications asynchronously to ensure scalability.
- Handle retries for failed notifications.

**Tech Stack:**  
Spring Boot, Twilio (for SMS), Firebase Cloud Messaging (for push notifications), RabbitMQ.

---  

## 5. Order Processing System for E-commerce
**Description:**  
Develop an order processing system where users can place orders, and the backend handles tasks like payment confirmation, inventory updates, and shipping asynchronously.

**Key Features:**
- Place an order and get an order ID.
- Process payments, update inventory, and notify the user asynchronously.
- Provide APIs for checking order status.

**Tech Stack:**  
Spring Boot, Stripe/PayPal API, Kafka (for task coordination).

---  

## 6. Log Analysis and Reporting System
**Description:**  
Design a system where users upload server logs, and the backend asynchronously processes the logs to generate insights (e.g., error patterns, traffic trends).

**Key Features:**
- Upload large log files.
- Process logs asynchronously to extract insights.
- Provide a dashboard to display results or download a report.

**Tech Stack:**  
Spring Boot, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK stack).

---  

## 7. Video Encoding Platform
**Description:**  
Build a service to upload and convert videos to various formats (e.g., MP4, AVI) asynchronously. This is similar to how platforms like YouTube process video uploads.

**Key Features:**
- Upload videos and get a task ID.
- Process videos asynchronously (e.g., compress, format conversion).
- Notify users when processing is complete.

**Tech Stack:**  
Spring Boot, FFmpeg (for video processing), AWS S3.

---  

## 8. Chatbot Training System
**Description:**  
Develop an API for training chatbots asynchronously using large datasets. Users upload training data, and the system trains the model in the background.

**Key Features:**
- Upload training data for a chatbot.
- Asynchronous processing of data to train the bot.
- Retrieve the status of training and the model when it's ready.

**Tech Stack:**  
Spring Boot, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Kafka, AWS S3.

---  

## 9. Background Image Processing API
**Description:**  
Offer an API for applying filters, resizing, or watermarking images asynchronously. Useful for platforms needing image transformations.

**Key Features:**
- Upload images and choose processing tasks.
- Process tasks asynchronously and retrieve results via task ID.
- Integrate with cloud storage for scalability.

**Tech Stack:**  
Spring Boot, OpenCV/ImageMagick, AWS S3.

---  

## 10. IoT Device Data Aggregator
**Description:**  
Design a service to collect and process data from IoT devices asynchronously. Devices send data to the server, which processes it in the background for analytics.

**Key Features:**
- Collect data from IoT devices.
- Process and store data asynchronously.
- Provide APIs for retrieving aggregated results.

**Tech Stack:**  
Spring Boot, MQTT (for device communication), Kafka, InfluxDB.
